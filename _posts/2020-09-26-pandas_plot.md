> The plotly Python package is an open-source library built on plotly.js which in turn is built on d3.js.
Weâ€™ll be using a wrapper on plotly called [cufflinks][2] designed to work with Pandas dataframes.
So, our entire stack is `cufflinks > plotly > plotly.js > d3.js` which means we get the efficiency of coding in Python with the incredible interactive graphics capabilities of **D3**. [1][1]

> Plotly itself is a graphics company with several products and open-source tools.
The Python library is free to use, and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode
plus up to 25 charts in online mode to share with the world. [1][1]
