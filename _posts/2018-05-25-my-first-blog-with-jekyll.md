### Customize Layouts Theme
If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. Copy the original template from the theme's repository
2. (Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier)
3. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
4. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
Customize the layout as you'd like
