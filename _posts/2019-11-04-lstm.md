### Input Layer
The LSTM input layer is specified by the `input_shape` argument on the **first hidden layer** of the network.
The input of the LSTM is always is a 3D array. `(batch_size, time_steps, seq_len)`

* **Samples** One sequence is one sample. A batch is comprised of one or more samples.
* **Time Steps** One time step is one point of observation in the sample.
* **Features** One feature is one observation at a time step.

For example, the model below defines an input layer that expects 1 or more samples, 10 time steps, and 1 features.

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(32, input_shape=(10, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
```

#### One-dimensional sequence data

```python
from numpy import array
# one sequence of multiple time steps and one feature
data = array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0])

# reshape this one-dimensional array into a three-dimensional array
# with 1 sample, 10 time steps, and 1 feature at each time step
data = data.reshape((1, 10, 1))
print(data.shape)
# (1, 10, 1)
```

#### Multiple parallel series data
Two parallel series of 10 values
```
series 1: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0
series 2: 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
```


```python
from numpy import array

# data as a matrix of 2 columns with 10 rows
data = array([
	[0.1, 1.0],
	[0.2, 0.9],
	[0.3, 0.8],
	[0.4, 0.7],
	[0.5, 0.6],
	[0.6, 0.5],
	[0.7, 0.4],
	[0.8, 0.3],
	[0.9, 0.2],
	[1.0, 0.1]])
# reshaped as a 3D array : as 1 sample with 10 time steps and 2 features    
data = data.reshape(1, 10, 2)
print(data.shape)
# (1, 10, 2)
```
