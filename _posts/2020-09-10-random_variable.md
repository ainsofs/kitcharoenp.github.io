### [Key Takeaways][1]
* A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes.
* A random variable can be either discrete (having specific values) or continuous (any value in a continuous range).
* The use of random variables is most common in probability and statistics, where they are used to quantify outcomes of random occurrences.
* Risk analysts use random variables to estimate the probability of an adverse event occurring.


As a statistical tool, a frequency distribution provides a visual representation for the distribution of observations within a particular test.
