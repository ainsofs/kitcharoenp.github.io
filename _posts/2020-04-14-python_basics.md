### Escape Sequences
```Python
# r will tell python that string will be display as raw string
# display the backslash
print(r" Michael Jackson \ is the best" )
```

### String Operations
```Python
# Find the substring in the string. Only the index of the first elment of substring in string will be the output

Name = "Michael Jackson"
Name.find('el')

# If the sub-string is not in the string then the output is a negative one

Name.find('Jasdfasdasdf') # output -1
```
