Time series, as the name suggests, are **collections of data points that are indexed by time**. Given a set of time series, you might ask various kinds of questions:

* How will the time series evolve in the future? **Forecasting**
* Is the behavior of the time series in a given period abnormal? **Anomaly detection**
* Which group does a given time series belong to? **Time series classification**
* Some measurements are missing, what were their values? **Imputation**

**GluonTS** allows you to address these questions by simplifying the process of building time series `models`. Numerous pre-built block of time series models have been proposed. GluonTS contains [reference implementations](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/tree/master/src/gluonts/model) of deep-learning-based time series models from the literature.

 * Deep Factor
 * Deep AR
 * Deep State
 * Gaussian Processes (GP)
 * Facebook Prophet
 * ...

### [Pandas Time Series frequencies Aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases)
A number of string aliases are given to useful common time series frequencies.

* B 	business day frequency
* C 	custom business day frequency
* D 	calendar day frequency
* W 	weekly frequency
