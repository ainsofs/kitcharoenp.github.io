**What is a model?**

A model is a fundamental building block of the content repository that provides a foundation for structuring content and working with content.

**Custom types**

A custom type enumerates the properties and relationships that a file of that type can support. **Content** and **Folder** are the two important types defined out-of-the-box.

**Aspects**

An aspect is a collection of properties that can encapsulate both data and behaviour, providing a flexible tool for modeling content.

**property**

Properties are pieces of metadata associated with a particular custom type and / or aspect.

### Layout Designer
Use the Layout Designer to define how the properties you create using the Model Manager are displayed on the **Edit Properties** page in Alfresco Share.
