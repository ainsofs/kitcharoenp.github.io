### [What is the Difference between a List and a Tuple?][1]

> * Both lists and tuples are sequence data types that can store a collection of items.
> * You can also access any item by its index.
> * The main difference between lists and a tuples is the fact that **lists are mutable** whereas **tuples are immutable**.

### [Immutable object][2]
An **immutable object** (unchangeable[1] object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

A **mutable object** (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created.

### Lists
```python
>>> list_a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### tuple
```python
>>> tuple_a = ('a', 'b', 'c')
```
